                    <p>Boston Dynamics unveiled yesterday a massively upgraded version of its ATLAS humanoid that is smaller, lighter, and more agile. The new robot is seen walking untethered in snow-covered woods, lifting and placing boxes on shelves, and even face-planting and immediately getting up unscathed after being pushed by an engineer.</p>
                    <p>What is perhaps most impressive about the “next generation” ATLAS is that it is just a huge technological leap forward compared to its predecessor, which was already a pretty incredible robot. The new ATLAS can do things we’ve never seen other robots doing before, making it one of the most advanced humanoids in existence. So, how did Boston Dynamics do it?</p>
                    <p>“The engineering team did a huge amount of work to make ATLAS lighter and more compact,” Marc Raibert, founder and president of Boston Dynamics, told IEEE Spectrum. “One thing we did was use 3D printing to create the legs, so the actuators and hydraulic lines are embedded in the structure, rather than made out of separate components. We also developed custom servo-valves that are significantly smaller and lighter (and work better) than the aerospace versions we had been using.” He added that there were lots of “other work by a great team that I won’t go into.”</p>
                    <p>It’s hard to tell exactly how close Boston Dynamics is to this “vision for the future” with the new ATLAS, but it’s worth mentioning that they’re not the only ones taking this approach.</p>
